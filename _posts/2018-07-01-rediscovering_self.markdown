A year ago today I finished my first year as a high school physics teacher. Summer break was halfway over.

I entered teaching after having come in from working as a consulting geologist. The work was mostly interesting and the pay was decent. But it's hard to maintain a marriage and friendships when your schedule is inconsistent, workload is brutal, and you're always out of town. In fact, there was a joke of sorts shared amongst my friends in the field: During an interview for a [entry level environmental] geologist position, the interviewer asks, "Where do you see yourself in three years? Answer: "A project manager and divorced." 

Burnout was inevitable. 

I knew that if I was going to work crazy hours, that I should at least find a way to have more control over my schedule. Teaching high school science fit the bill. Sure I'd be stressed and working all the time, but it would be a solid step in the right direction. So I chipped away at earning my certifications to teach whenever I could find time. In the summer of 2016 I turned in my notice and was offered a position to teach physics at a socioeconomically disadvantaged urban high school. They always tell you that the first year is going to be hard, but knowing is not the same as experiencing. In a very real sense, it was a nightmare. 

Bringing us to where the real story starts. 

While looking for a hobby that I could do sporadically and in short bursts, I discovered Minecraft. Whether I wanted to explore, build stuff, or just see what other people had made, there was always something available to me that would take my mind away from obsessing about work and my students. Since compartmentalizing my work and non-work life has always been hard, this was a godsend. Most importantly, up until this point I had never tried to really explore my creative side (pretty certain that I didn't have one). After all, my attention had always been about deconstructing problems... though you could technically argue that solving problems is a creative process in and of itself but whatever.

Summer of 2017 arrived and all of a sudden I had an enormous amount of free time. With minor exceptions, literally overnight I went from always having something that needed to be done, to having zero deadlines, meetings, crises to stress about, etc. you name it. I had no idea what to do with this extra time but I did know that I needed time to take care of myself, decompress, and reflect.

I ended up picking up a new hobby. At the time I was experimenting with building sky islands and modern residential structures. But in building this stuff, there was an awful lot of repetition and things that I wish I could do but readily couldn't. So it occurred to me that maybe I could have more fun and speed up some of these processes if I used Minecraft mods. After discovering what was out there, I decided that I absolutely had to get in on this. I was going to spend my summer learning a little Java and making sweet Minecraft mods. 

After learning to code for several weeks and starting to build things, I developed an itch that couldn't quite be scratched to satisfaction. From there I harassed a few of my college friends (software engineers/web developers) and learned about what they actually do and how the work culture is almost universally worlds apart from what I had experienced up to this point. Within another few weeks I enrolled at the Flatiron School bootcamp prep course to further see if web development was something I wanted to get deeper into. 

When you're coding you always have a problem you're trying to figure out, always hypothesizing, always testing that hypothesis, and always reiterating to see if there are better solutions. I was excited to realize that programming is a very scientific process. 

I needed another year of teaching to come to terms with the fact that I wasn't giving up on science or teaching or my students. I was confirming that I love science, that I love the learning process, and that there are other teachers out there that care just as much about their students, but are better equipped to serve their needs than I can. And as hard as that last one is for me to accept, that's okay. 

Fast forward ten months later. 

As much as my schedule allows, I've been keeping up with programming and love the challenge of it more every day. Now that it's summer time again, it's hard to hold back the daily excitement knowing that after going full burn for a couple more months, I'll have the basic tools and knowledge to transition from student to web developer!
